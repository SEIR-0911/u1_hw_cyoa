Homework Overview
Using what you know about data types, variables, operators, conditional blocks, and accepting user input, you'll be creating a text-based game that allows the user to arrive at different "destinations" based on the inputs they type.

Requirements
Any path the user goes down must ask them at least three questions.*

There must be a minimum of seven total destinations the user could arrive at based on their responses.*

For at least one of the questions asked, there must be more than two possible user responses.*

Your adventure must offer the user an option to replay at the end.*

Your code must contain at least one switch statement.**

Your code must make use of both string and number user inputs.*

Hint: You may need :

* parseInt()
* toString()
* prompt
* confirm ()
* alert

//ex1
// prompts user and stores value in the variable
let valueOfPrompt = prompt()
// logs value stored
console.log(valueOfPrompt)

//ex2
let age = prompt('How old are you?')
// ES6 String Interpolation
alert(`You are ${age} years old.`)
// ES5 Version
alert('You are ' + age + ' years old.')
